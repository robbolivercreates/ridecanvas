// ============================================================================

export const ANALYZE_VEHICLE_PROMPT = `
Act as an Expert Automotive Analyst and Car Culture Specialist. Analyze this vehicle with EXTREME attention to detail.

1. **Identity:** Make, Model, Year, Color.

2. **Category Classification:** Determine which category best fits:
   - "Off-Road" (SUVs with mods, lifted trucks, 4x4s, overlanders, Land Rovers, Jeeps, Toyota 4Runners, etc.)
   - "Sports" (coupes, hot hatches, muscle cars, performance vehicles)
   - "Luxury" (premium sedans, executive SUVs like Range Rover Sport, BMW X5, etc.)
   - "Classic" (vintage/retro vehicles, pre-1990)
   - "Everyday" (hatchbacks, sedans, minivans, economy cars)

3. **Is Off-Road:** Boolean - does this vehicle have off-road modifications OR is it an overland-capable 4x4 vehicle by nature?

4. **Orientation:** Exactly which side is shown (Driver Side/Passenger Side) and which way is it facing (Left/Right).

5. **Geometry Audit:** Silhouette, Window Layout, Lights, Bumpers.

6. **WHEEL & TIRE AUDIT (CRITICAL - BE EXTREMELY PRECISE):**
   Look VERY carefully at the wheels and tires. Answer these questions with what you ACTUALLY SEE:
   
   - hasWhiteLettering: Do the tires have WHITE LETTERS on the sidewall? (true/false)
     * Look for brand names like "BFGoodrich", "Cooper", "Goodyear" in white
     * If NO white text is visible on the tire sidewall → false
     * If you see white text/letters on the tire → true
   
   - hasCenterCaps: Are there center caps visible on the wheels? (true/false)
   
   - centerCapColor: If center caps exist, what color are they? ("black", "silver", "body-color", "chrome", "none visible")
   
   - wheelColor: What is the main color of the wheels? ("black", "silver", "gray", "bronze", "white", "body-color", "chrome")
   
   - wheelFinish: What is the wheel finish? ("matte", "gloss", "machined", "polished")
   
   - wheelType: Are these stock or aftermarket? ("stock OEM", "aftermarket alloy", "steel wheels", "unknown")
   
   BE HONEST: If you cannot clearly see a detail, say "not visible" rather than guessing.

7. **INSTALLED ACCESSORIES (CRITICAL):** List EVERY visible accessory and modification installed on this specific vehicle. Be extremely thorough:
   - Roof: roof rack, roof box, rooftop tent, awning, light bars, antennas
   - Exterior: mudguards/mud flaps, fender flares, side steps, running boards, rock sliders
   - Front: bull bar, nudge bar, winch, auxiliary lights, skid plate
   - Rear: spare tire carrier, bike rack, ladder, rear bumper, tow hitch
   - Windows: window guards, rain deflectors, tinting
   - Other: snorkel, jerry cans, recovery boards, decals, stickers, badges
   ONLY list what you can ACTUALLY SEE. Do not assume or guess.

8. **Character Marks:** Unique identifiers: stickers, decals, brand logos, mud splashes, dirt patterns, scratches.

9. **Popular Modifications:** Use Google Search to find what enthusiasts commonly do to customize this specific make/model. List 4-5 popular mods.

10. **Popular Wheels:** Use Google Search to find the most popular aftermarket wheel brands/styles that enthusiasts put on this specific make/model. List 2-3 popular wheel options with brand and style.

11. **Suggested Stance:** Based on the vehicle category:
    - For Off-Road vehicles: suggest "Stock", "Lifted + AT", or "Steelies + Mud"
    - For other vehicles: suggest "Stock" or "Lowered + Wheels"

12. **Suggested Background:** Based on the vehicle type, suggest the best background theme.

GOLDEN RULE: "If it's in the photo, include it. If it's NOT in the photo, DON'T invent it."

REPRODUCE EXACTLY:
✓ WHEELS: Copy the exact wheel design, color, and style from the source
  - Follow the WHEEL & TIRE AUDIT above EXACTLY
  - NO white lettering on tires unless WHEEL AUDIT says YES
  - NO colored center caps unless WHEEL AUDIT says YES
  - NO aftermarket wheel style if source has stock wheels
✓ DIRT/MUD: Same amount and intensity as source - don't exaggerate or minimize
✓ TEXT/LOGOS: Reproduce exactly as shown (e.g., "BEACH", "California", badges)
  - If you can't read it clearly, reproduce it as best you can
✓ ACCESSORIES: Include ALL visible accessories exactly as they appear
✓ COLORS: Exact vehicle colors from source

DO NOT INVENT:
✗ White sidewall lettering on tires (unless WHEEL AUDIT explicitly says YES!)
✗ Red/colored wheel center caps that don't exist
✗ Extra dirt, mud, or scratches beyond what's shown
✗ Bicycles, cargo, or items not in the source
✗ People, animals, or figures
✗ Logos, badges, or text that don't exist

If rack is EMPTY in source → draw it EMPTY
If rack has items → reproduce ONLY those exact items

⚠️ VEHICLE PROPORTIONS - DO NOT DISTORT ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The vehicle in your output MUST have the EXACT SAME PROPORTIONS as in the reference art.

DO NOT:
✗ Stretch the vehicle horizontally to fill wider formats
✗ Compress the vehicle vertically 
✗ Change the width-to-height ratio of the car
✗ Make the car look "squashed" or "elongated"

DO:
✓ Keep the vehicle's proportions IDENTICAL to the reference
✓ Add MORE BACKGROUND to fill the new aspect ratio
✓ Extend the sky, ground, or scenery - NOT the car
✓ The car should look like it was copy-pasted from the reference

STYLE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
- EXACT same color palette as reference
- EXACT same artistic style and line work
- EXACT same background elements (extend them, don't change them)
- EXACT same level of detail and shading
- The vehicle should be PIXEL-PERFECT identical in proportions
- EXACT same CONDITION of the vehicle (if it has mud, dirt, scratches in the reference, include them!)
- If the reference shows a dirty/muddy vehicle, ALL outputs MUST show the same dirt/mud
